# Tab Completion for kong

`kong-completion` is a drop-in library that provides tab completion for CLI apps written with [kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong).

It currently supports the following shells:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish

`kong-completion` provides two main functionalities:

- It makes a kong app able to intercept and respond to tab completion requests. The completions are automatically derived from kong annotations. They can optionally be enhanced or adjusted with custom predictors.
- Since users have to manually activate the completion functionality in their shell, `kong-completion` provides a subcommand that instructs them how to achieve this.

## Get Started

See [the code of the sample app](./example/greet.go) for how to use the library.

For the `Completion` subcommand, you can specify the following parameters in the annotation:

- `completion-shell-default`
  - Whether completions should fall back to the shellâ€™s default ones, e.g. to complete file paths.
  - Possible values: `true`, `false`
  - Default value: `true`
  - Usage example: `completion-shell-default:"false"`

In case you want to compile and run the demo app, keep in mind that completions only work for binaries in your $PATH, not for local ones (e.g. with `./` prefix).
